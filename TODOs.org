** TODO Setup CI so we can make sure the library is building on all platforms when we make changes
** TODO Figure out how we can log from our library to Godot

To keep it cross platform, the API needs to work through only function calls and passing common primitives like characters, strings, and integers

I think it may make sense to have it work similarly to a REST API, where objects in the C++ lib are addressed by ids or keys
